				<p>[To ALONSO]</p>
				<div>
					<a href="commentary.html#lakin" id="lakin" title="Jump to Definition">By'r lakin</a>
					, I can go no further, sir;<br />
					My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed<br />
					Through <a href="commentary.html#forth" id="forth" title="Jump to Definition">forth-rights and meanders</a>
					! By your patience,<br />
					I needs must rest me.
				</div>
					 
				<h2>ALONSO</h2>
				<div>
					Old lord, I cannot blame thee,<br />
					Who am myself <a href="commentary.html#attachd" id="attachd" title="Jump to Definition">attach'd</a> 
					with weariness,<br />
					To the <a href="commentary.html#dulling" id="dulling" title="Jump to Definition">dulling</a> 
					of my spirits: sit down, and rest.<br />
					<a href="commentary.html#even" id="even" title="Jump to Definition">Even</a> 
					here I will put off my hope and keep

					No longer for my <a href="commentary.html#flatterer" id="flatterer" title="Jump to Definition">flatterer</a>

					Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks<br />
					Our <a href="commentary.html#frustrate" id="frustrate" title="Jump to Definition">frustrate</a> 
					search on land. Well, let him go.
				</div>
				
				
				<h2>ANTONIO</h2>
				<p>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]</p>
				<div>
					I am right glad that he's so out of hope.<br />
					Do not, for one <a href="commentary.html#repulse" id="repulse" title="Jump to Definition">repulse</a>
					, forego the purpose<br />
					That you resolved to effect.
				</div>
				
				<h2>SEBASTIAN</h2>
				<p>[Aside to ANTONIO]</p>
				<div>The next advantage Will we take throughly.</div>
				 
				<h2>ANTONIO</h2>
				<p>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]</p>
				<div>
					Let it be to-night;<br />
					For, <a href="commentary.html#travail" id="travail" title="Jump to Definition">now they are oppress'd with travail</a>
					, they<br />
					Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance<br />
					As when they are fresh.
				</div>
					
				<h2>SEBASTIAN</h2>
				<p>[Aside to ANTONIO]</p>
				<div>
					I say, to-night: no more.<br />
					<br />
					Solemn and strange music
				</div>
				
				<h2>ALONSO</h2>
					<div>What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!</div>
				
				<h2>GONZALO</h2>
					<div>Marvellous sweet music!</div>

				<p>
					[Enter <a href="cast.html#prospero" title="Jump to Actor Description" id="prospero">Prospero</a> 
					above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;<br /> 
					they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King and company<br />
					to eat, they depart]
				</p>

				<h2>ALONSO</h2>
				<div>
					Give us kind <a href="commentary.html#keepers" id="keepers" title="Jump to Definition">keepers</a>
					, heavens! What were these?
				</div>

				<h2>SEBASTIAN</h2>
				<div>
					A <a href="commentary.html#living" id="living" title="Jump to Definition">living drollery</a>
					. Now I will believe<br />
					That there are unicorns, that in Arabia<br />
					There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix<br />
					At this hour reigning there.
				</div>

				<h2>ANTONIO</h2>
				<div>
					I'll believe both;<br />
					And <a href="commentary.html#credit" id="credit" title="Jump to Definition">what does else want credit</a>
					, come to me,<br />
					And I'll be sworn 'tis true: 
					<a href="commentary.html#travellers" id="travellers" title="Jump to Definition">travellers ne'er did lie,</a><br />
					Though fools at home condemn 'em.
				</div>

				<h2>GONZALO</h2>
				<div>
					If in Naples
					I should report this now, would they believe me?<br />
					If I should say, I saw such islanders--<br />
					For, <a href="commentary.html#certes" id="certes" title="Jump to Definition">certes</a>
					, these are people of the island--<br />
					Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,<br />
					Their manners are more 
					<a href="commentary.html#gentle" id="gentle" title="Jump to Definition">gentle-kind</a> 
					than of<br />
					Our human generation you shall find<br />
					Many, nay, almost any.
				</div>

				<h2>PROSPERO</h2>
				<div>
					[Aside] Honest lord,<br />
					Thou hast said well; for some of you there present<br />
					Are worse than devils.
				</div>

				<h2>ALONSO</h2>
				<div>
					I cannot too much muse<br />
					Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,<br />
					Although they want the use of tongue, a kind<br />
					Of excellent dumb discourse.
				</div>
	
				<h2>PROSPERO</h2>
					<div>[Aside] Praise in departing.</div>

				<h2>FRANCISCO</h2>
				<div>They vanish'd strangely.</div>

				<h2>SEBASTIAN</h2>
				<div>
					No matter, since<br />
					They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.<br />
					Will't please you taste of what is here?
				</div>

				<h2>ALONSO</h2>
				<div>Not I.</div>

				<h2>GONZALO</h2>
				<div>
					Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,<br />
					Who would believe that there were mountaineers<br />
					Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em<br />
					Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men<br />
					Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find<br />
					Each putter-out of five for one will bring us<br />
					Good warrant of.
				</div>
	
				<h2>ALONSO</h2>
				<div>
					I will stand to and feed,<br />
					Although my last: no matter, since I feel<br />
					The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,<br />
					Stand to and do as we.
				</div>

				<p>
					[Thunder and lightning. Enter <a href="cast.html#ariel" title="Jump to Actor Description" id="ariel">Ariel</a>, 
					like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]
				</p>

				<h2>ARIEL</h2>
				<div>
					You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,<br />
					That hath to instrument this lower world<br />
					And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea<br />
					Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island<br />
					Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men<br />
					Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;<br />
					And even with such-like valour men hang and drown<br />
					Their proper selves.
				</div>

					<p>[ALONSO, SEBASTIAN & c. draw their swords]<p>
				<div>
					You fools! I and my fellows<br />
					Are ministers of Fate: the elements,<br />
					Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well<br />
					Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs<br />
					Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish<br />
					One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers<br />
				   Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,<br />
			  	   Your swords are now too massy for your strengths<br />
					And will not be uplifted. But remember--<br />
					For that's my business to you--that you three<br />
					From Milan did supplant good Prospero;<br />
					Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,<br />
					Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed<br />
					The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have<br />
					Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,<br />
					Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,<br />
					They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:<br />
					Lingering perdition, worse than any death<br />
					Can be at once, shall step by step attend<br />
					You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--<br />
					Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls<br />
					Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow<br />
					And a clear life ensuing.
				</div>

				<p>
					[He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, 
					with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]
				</p>

				<h2>PROSPERO</h2>
				<div>
					Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou<br />
					Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:<br />
					Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated<br />
					In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life<br />
					And observation strange, my meaner ministers<br />
					Their several kinds have done. My high charms work<br />
					And these mine enemies are all knit up<br />
					In their distractions; they now are in my power;<br />
					And in these fits I leave them, while I visit<br />
					Young <a href="cast.html#ferdinand" title="Jump to Actor Description" id="ferdinand">Ferdinand</a>, 
					whom they suppose is drown'd,<br />
					And his and mine loved darling.
				</div>

				<p>[Exit above]</p>

				<h2>GONZALO</h2>
				<div>
					I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you<br />
					In this strange stare?
				</div>

				<h2>ALONSO</h2>
				<div>
					O, it is monstrous, monstrous:<br />
					Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;<br />
					The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,<br />
					That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced<br />
					The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.<br />
					Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedived, and<br />
					I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded<br />
					And with him there lie mudived.
				</div>

				<p>[Exit]</p>

				<h2>SEBASTIAN</h2>
				<div>
					But one fiend at a time,<br />
					I'll fight their legions o'er.
				</div>

				<h2>ANTONIO</h2>
				<div>I'll be thy second.</div>

				<p>
					[<a href="commentary.html#exeunt" id="exeunt" title="Jump to Definition">Exeunt</a> 
					SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]
				</p>

				<h2>GONZALO</h2>
				<div>
					All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,<br />
					Like poison given to work a great time after,<br />
					Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you<br />
					That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly<br />
					And hinder them from what this ecstasy<br />
					May now provoke them to.
				</div>

				<h2>ADRIAN</h2>
				<div>Follow, I pray you.</div>

				<p>[Exeunt]</p>
